# Low Power / Wireless FABI3 (LP/W FABI3)

### Overview
The **Low Power / Wireless FABI3 (LP/W FABI3)** project aims to improve the FABI (Flexible Assistive Button Interface) to provide more efficient, wireless operation with an integrated, rechargeable battery system. This interface, designed for users requiring alternative input methods, enables computer control via adaptable DIY devices such as switches, pressure sensors, and other assistive technologies.

This project is part of an open-source initiative by [AsTeRICS](https://github.com/asterics), focusing on enhancing accessibility solutions for individuals with limited motor capabilities.

### Project Goals
The key objectives for the LP/W FABI3 project include:
- **Reducing Power Consumption**: Implement methods such as clock gating and sleep modes to optimize energy efficiency.
- **Integrating a Rechargeable Battery**: Replace the external power bank with an onboard, rechargeable battery and battery management system.
- **Redesigning the PCB**: Create a new PCB layout that incorporates the battery and management system without impacting device functionality.

### Project Team
- **Project Lead**: Jimmi Bacher
- **Roles**: Hardware Development, Embedded Software, Test Planning, Documentation
- **Advisor**: FH Prof. DI MSc Christoph Veigl
